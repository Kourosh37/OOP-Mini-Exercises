/**
 * ?? STUDENT GRADE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 * 
 * ?? DESCRIPTION:
 * Build a system to manage student information and grades.
 * 
 * ?? LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - Work with ArrayList and collections
 * - Implement calculation methods
 * - Practice data validation
 * - Learn to organize related data
 * 
 * ?? REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * Student Class:
 * ? Private fields:
 *    - studentId (String): unique identifier
 *    - name (String): full name
 *    - grades (ArrayList<Double>): list of grade scores
 *    - department (String): major department
 * 
 * ? Constructor:
 *    - Student(studentId, name, department)
 *    - Initialize empty grades list
 * 
 * ? Public Methods:
 *    - addGrade(grade): Add a grade to student record
 *      ? Validate: grade between 0.0 and 100.0
 *    
 *    - removeGrade(index): Remove grade at specific position
 *    - calculateAverage(): Return average of all grades
 *    - getHighestGrade(): Return highest grade
 *    - getLowestGrade(): Return lowest grade
 *    - getLetterGrade(): Return overall letter grade
 *    - getStudentInfo(): Return formatted student information
 * 
 * ?? EXTRA CHALLENGE:
 * - Add course names for each grade
 * - Implement GPA calculation
 * - Add semester/year for each grade
 * 
 * ?? IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
 * 1. Create Student class with basic fields
 * 2. Initialize ArrayList in constructor
 * 3. Implement addGrade() with validation
 * 4. Create calculation methods
 * 5. Test with various grade scenarios
