/**
 * ????? EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
 * 
 * ?? DESCRIPTION:
 * Create an employee management system with salary calculations.
 * 
 * ?? LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * - Understand inheritance hierarchies
 * - Implement method overriding
 * - Practice polymorphic behavior
 * 
 * ?? REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * Abstract Employee Class:
 * ? Protected fields:
 *    - name (String): employee name
 *    - employeeId (String): unique ID
 *    - baseSalary (double): monthly salary
 * 
 * ? Abstract Methods:
 *    - calculateSalary(): Calculate total monthly salary
 *    - getRole(): Return employee role
 * 
 * FullTimeEmployee Class:
 * ? Additional field:
 *    - bonus (double): annual bonus
 * 
 * ? Implement:
 *    - calculateSalary(): Return (baseSalary + bonus/12)
 * 
 * PartTimeEmployee Class:
 * ? Additional fields:
 *    - hoursWorked (int): monthly hours
 *    - hourlyRate (double): pay per hour
 * 
 * ? Implement:
 *    - calculateSalary(): Return hoursWorked * hourlyRate
 * 
 * ?? EXTRA CHALLENGE:
 * - Add department information
 * - Implement performance reviews
 * - Add employee promotion system
 * 
 * ?? IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
 * 1. Start with abstract Employee class
 * 2. Implement FullTimeEmployee first
 * 3. Create PartTimeEmployee
 * 4. Test polymorphism
